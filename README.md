## Build

To build the project you need to install:
- NodeJs 
- Typescript (TSC) 
- GNU make (make)

to clone and build run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Empitrix/asm_web && cd ./asm_web
make
```

after that you will have a `./dist/main.js` and by running the `index.html` into your browser you'll have the assembler.
